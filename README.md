# GiftFinder
##### Author: Michael Halim

A recommender engine that recommends gift categories and products from a recipient's Twitter history. A user can go to the web-app and enter the gift-recipient's Twitter handle and the model identifies top three gift categories that the recipient may be interested in. Then, popular gift items in Amazon, identified from various gift blogs, are recommended based on similarity to the predicted categories.
